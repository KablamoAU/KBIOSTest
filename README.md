###iOS test

###Instructions
Please build an iPhone application that displayes a bouncing ball. The bouncing ball should:
* Begin in the top left corner of a view
* With a gravity like effect fall to the bottom of the view contacting the center-bottom of the view
* Bounce to the top right of the view

The application should support both iPhone 4 & 5 devices in portrait orientation.

We want to see how you build the application, so please do not use any pre-canned 3rd party libraries, game libraries, or frameworks, eg cocos2d. We expect that you should not need to use any image assets, png's, jpegs, etc

Please fork this repo to your personal Github account, and once complete allow us with access to your repo.

When submitting your test, please specify any tools you have used, including the editor you used to write your code, and the instruments used to test performance.

###General requirements and considerations
Generally, you should build this app in the way that you feel it should be built, however the following should be taken into consideration: 

* Memory: 
Ensure that the application is properly handles memory as efficiently as necessary.

* Standards compliance: 
Ensure that your code utilises apples standards for naming conventions, and only publicly available API's are used.

* Objective-C:
Ensure you write neat, tidy code that you would consider suitable for a deployable application.
